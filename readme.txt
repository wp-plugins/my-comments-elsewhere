This plugin collects the comments you posted on other people's websites and lets you display them on your own blog.

== Description ==

This plugin will track all comments you make on other blogs and download them back to your own site. You can then display these comments as a paginated listing, install a widget, or automatically create daily/weekly digest posts.

The plugin uses either [BackType](http://www.backtype.com/) or [CoComment](http://www.cocomment.com/) to track your comments.
